@ Qualifer is used with @Autowired annotation.
if we have multiple instances/beans of an objective dependecies in xml file then we can specify which bean id
to be injected to the objective type dependency 

@Resource- JSR-250 can be an alternative as @qualifer and @autowired
Java Specification Request (JSR): these annotations belong to Java not Spring (they come from Javax package) not String package

@PreDestroy and @PostConstruct are also JSR annotations
