Spring Auto Wiring:
How to inject and object inside a bean implicitly, that is we will not provide the information using the <property> or 
<constructor-arg> in our xml file. here object will be injected inside the bean implicitly.
-Autowiring means injecting the object dependency implicitly. it internally uses setter/constructor injection
-Autowiring work with reference type only (objective type), it can not be used to inject primitive and String values
- by default it is disabled in the Spring framework 
-Autowiring can be performed either using "autowire" attribute  in <bean> or by using @Autowired annotation


Autowiring Modes:
1-no:		by default it is no. mean no autowiring
2-byName:	injects the object dependency by bean name. property name inside class and the bean name must be the same
and this will call the setter method to perform the object injection
3-byType:	inject according to the bean type and the dependency type inside the class. property name and the bean name 
can be differen. calls setter method
4-constructor:	injects by calling the constructor. it calls the contructor having the large number of parameters
it uses constructor injection
